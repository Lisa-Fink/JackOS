# Jack OS
This project is a basic operating system built in Jack, the high-level language for the NAND2Tetris course. 
As the final project in the course, this OS represents the culmination of building a computer from the ground upâ€”starting with constructing simulated hardware from simple logic gates, 
creating essential components like memory (RAM), an arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and a central processing unit (CPU). 
From there, the project progresses through the development of an assembler, a virtual machine (VM) translator, and a compiler, ultimately leading to the implementation of the operating system.

## Features
This Jack OS includes implementations of:

- Arithmetic Operations: Basic math functions like multiplication, division, square root, min/max, and absolute value.
- Memory Management: Functions for managing dynamic memory allocation, deallocation, and memory access.
- String and Array Manipulation: Library functions to handle string creation, modification, processing, and array creation.
- Input and Output: Functions to handle basic input and output, such as reading from the keyboard and displaying text on the screen.
- Screen and Drawing: Basic graphics functions to draw shapes and manipulate pixels on the screen.
